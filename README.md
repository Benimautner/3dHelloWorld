# 3dHelloWorld
This is a very basic game written with the unity game engine. It is not:
- a good game
- beautiful in any way, shape or form
- very playable

If you still want to try it out, give it a go.

To run it in Unity yourself you will have to install the third-party assets as I am not permitted to include them here.
You can also just download it from releases.
